## Responsive Layout Details

The dashboard's layout adapts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries defined in `App.css`.

### `dashboard-grid` Classes:
-   **Default**: `dashboard-grid-2` (2 columns), `dashboard-grid-3` (3 columns), `dashboard-grid-4` (4 columns).
-   **Up to 768px (Mobile)**: All `dashboard-grid` classes become 1 column.
-   **769px to 1024px (Tablet)**: `dashboard-grid-3` becomes 2 columns.
-   **1201px to 1919px (Desktop - e.g., 1725x970)**:
    -   `dashboard-grid-4` becomes 2 columns.
    -   `dashboard-grid-3` remains 3 columns.
    -   `dashboard-grid-2` remains 2 columns.
-   **1920px and above (Large Desktop)**:
    -   `dashboard-grid-4` remains 4 columns.
    -   `dashboard-grid-3` becomes 4 columns.
    -   `dashboard-grid-2` becomes 3 columns.
-   **2560px and above (Ultra-wide/4K)**:
    -   `dashboard-grid-3` becomes 4 columns.
    -   `dashboard-grid-2` becomes 3 columns.

### `professional-card` Styling:
-   **Default Padding**: `1.5rem`.
-   **Up to 768px (Mobile)**: Padding becomes `1rem`.
-   **1920px and above (Large Desktop)**: Padding becomes `2rem`.
-   **2560px and above (Ultra-wide/4K)**: Padding becomes `2.5rem`.
-   **Hover Effect**: `box-shadow: 0 4px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);` and `border-color: var(--border-accent);`.
-   **Dark Mode `box-shadow`**: More pronounced shadows are applied in dark mode, with further increased intensity on screens 1920px and wider.


Yes, you're absolutely right. The system is now fully prepared for real data with no more fake/demonstration data. Here's what we've done:

We've structured all components to accept and display real data when it's available
We've created the necessary functions to share data between components
We've set up the parsing logic to extract structured data from AI responses
We've prepared proper loading states and error handling for real API interactions
We've removed all hard-coded sample data that was just for demonstration
The dashboard and analysis components are now ready to receive and display actual AI analysis results without any fake data. When your backend API is ready to provide real analysis, the system will seamlessly display it in the professionally designed UI components we've created.

The only thing left would be to:

Implement your actual API endpoints for storing and retrieving analysis
Choose and implement your state management solution (Context API, Redux, etc.)
Connect the components to these real data sources using the functions we've already prepared
All the UI components will work with real data exactly as they're currently designed - the structure and layout are already production-ready.
